    <h1>Information about Websites</h1>  
    <p>  
        A <strong>website</strong> (also written as a <strong>web site</strong>) is one or more <strong>web pages</strong> and related content that is identified by a common <strong>domain name</strong> and published on at least one <strong>web server</strong>. Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, such as news, education, commerce, entertainment, or <strong>social media</strong>. <strong>Hyperlinking</strong> between web pages guides the navigation of the site, which often starts with a <strong>home page</strong>. The <strong>most-visited</strong> sites are <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>.  
    </p>  
    <p>  
        All publicly-accessible websites collectively constitute the <strong>World Wide Web</strong>. There are also private websites that can only be accessed on a <strong>private network</strong>, such as a company's internal website for its employees. <strong>Users</strong> can access websites on a range of devices, including <strong>desktops</strong>, <strong>laptops</strong>, <strong>tablets</strong>, and <strong>smartphones</strong>. The <strong>app</strong> used on these devices is called a <strong>web browser</strong>.
