        <h1>A Website</h1>  
        <p>  
            A <strong>website</strong> (also written as a <strong>web site</strong>) is one or more web pages and related content that is identified by a common   
            <em>domain name</em> and published on at least one web server. Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, such as   
            news, education, commerce, entertainment, or social media. Hyperlinking between web pages guides the navigation of the site, which often   
            starts with a <strong>home page</strong>. The most-visited sites are <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>,   
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a>, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a>.  
        </p>  
        <p>  
            All publicly-accessible websites collectively constitute the <strong>World Wide Web</strong>. There are also private websites that can only be   
            accessed on a <strong>private network</strong>, such as a company's internal website for its employees.   
            Users can access websites on a range of devices, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The app used on these devices is called   
            a <strong>web browser</strong>.
